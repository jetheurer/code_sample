# Xometry Code Challenge
This is a solution to the Xometry Code Challenge

1. Write a function that takes a mesh array (described below) and calculates the mesh's volume.
2. Write a unit test for the volume function in #1.
3. Write the title and text for a pull request you would open to merge this code.
4. Appropriately document the functions, modules, etc. you write as part of this code challenge.
5. Develop this code in a git repository.

# Pull request
* Implemented a function to determine the volume of a polygon
* Unit test uses 3 example .npy files

# Testing
```
nosetests -c setup.cfg
```

# Example Usage
```
$ python volume/volume.py -f tests/examples/shell.npy
```
